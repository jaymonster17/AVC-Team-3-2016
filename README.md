###Week 1 Checklist
- [x] Grace: Create AVC task plan, get everyone to sign and hand in plan on time.
- [x] Chris & Michael: Create code to test if robot moves forward.
- [x] Michael: Create github for group 3.
- [x] Aaron & Mayunk: assemble the chasis.
  
*Everyone has done there jobs for this week*
*We have set goals for the next week ([Week 2 Checklist](#week-2-checklist))


###Week 2 Checklist
- [x] Grace: Check with team on work theyve done and progress.
- [x] Chris & Micheal: Work through quadrant 1, look into quadrant 2, have 1 done by end of week.
- [ ] Aaron & Mayunk: Work on finalising the design for the chassis.
 
*As half were away for holidays, Chris and Michael were able to work on code for quadrant 2, but unable to test it as we werent able to actually work on it in the lab. Quadrant 1 is unfinished.*
*Chassis is not finalised.*
*We have made goals for week 3 ([Week 3 Checklist](#week-3-checklist))*


###Week 3 Checklist
- [x] Grace: Check on whats been done, help out with software and hardware working with quadrant 1 & 2.
- [x] Chris & Michael: Test out the code from 1st and second week, have gate opening and get robot following the line smoothly (maybe the derivative PID control system) before the 'B-' stage. Also think about a method for the robot to deal with T-junctions/90 degree turns etc.
- [x] Aaron & Mayunk: Have a good idea for a finalised chassis for up to the maze (flip the camera, add on the wheel etc). Also look at 3D modelling/printing a ball following wheel.

*In terms of software we have managed to complete all our tasks for the week. The robot now goes through the gate and through quadrant 1 and 2 without a hitch and does it very quicky infact (about 10s) after optimisation. Speed looks good. We have put thought into quadrant 2/3 with the 90 degree turns etc and come up with two viable solutions which we will look to implement next week.*
*Hardware, everything is in place, and looking to do CAD next week. We talked with the software guys and decided how many sensors we need for the maze so we can fully design and do the CAD.*


###Week 4 Checklist
- [x] Grace: Make sure team is up to date, help with any work that is falling behind. Help with getting the CAD design ready and anything the software needs help with.
- [x] Chris & Michael: Refine and further design and then implement quadrant 2/3 code to get it up to the maze stage. Will implement it at a slow rate first and then try tweek it to get through faster and faster. Optimisation may not be done by end of Week 4 due to other commitments like the COMP test and other assignments.
- [x] Aaron & Mayunk: Work on the CAD the design and make sure we have a good design done by end of week.

*As we had the comp 102 test on the same day as our lab, we didnt seem to get much done. Hardware managed to some what agree on the design, but having trouble with CAD. Hopefully we can have something to print next week. Software managed to get rid of some bugs and modify the code.*


###Week 5 Checklist
- [x] Grace: Get the right measurements for the CAD design, get everyone together for what needs to be done. 
- [x] Chris & Michael: Further work on quadrant 3?
- [x] Aaron & Mayunk: Work on CAD design ~~and placement of IR sensors.~~

*We managed to get our CAD designs from both Grace and Aaron onto one file and have that ready for printing. Hardware worked on a base for our bot on freeCAD. Sensor placement pushed back after the lab. Software managed to get the t junction working on our code, therefore able to get through quadrant 3.* 


###Week 6 Checklist
- [ ] Grace: 
- [ ] Chris & Michael: 
- [ ] Aaron & Mayunk: 

###Week 7 Checklist to come



###Weekly Checklist
 * Have we discussed what needs to be done for the following week?
 * Is everything from this week done?
 * What tasks we need to do first when we get into the lab?
 * Have we updated code and photos on github?
 * If you havent done everything that is needed ask for help from other members of the team.
