# AVC-Team-3-2016

*Week 1*
  * Grace: Create AVC task plan, get everyone to sign and hand in plan on time.
  * Chris & Michael: Create code to test if robot moves forward.
  * Michael: Create github for group 3.
  * Aaron & Mayunk: assemble the chasis.
  
*Everyone has done there jobs for this week*
  
  

*Week 2 - Break*
 * Grace: Check with team on work theyve done and progress.
 * Chris & Micheal: Work through quadrant 1, have it done by end of week.
 * Aaron & Mayunk: Work on finalising the design for the chassis.
 

*As half were away for holidays, Chris and Michael were able to work on code for quadrant 2, but unable to test it as we werent able to actually work on it in the lab. Quadrant 1 is unfinished.*
*Chassis is not finalised.*

*Week 3 - back from break*
 * Grace: Check on whats been done, help out with software and hardware working with quadrant 1 & 2.
 * Chris & Michael: Test out the code from 1st and second week, have gate opening and get robot following the line smoothly (maybe the derivative PID control system) before the 'B-' stage. Also think about a method for the robot to deal with T-junctions/90 degree turns etc.
 * Aaron & Mayunk: Have a good idea for a finalised chassis for up to the maze (flip the camera, add on the wheel etc). Also look at 3D modelling/printing a ball following wheel.
